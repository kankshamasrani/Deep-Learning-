1. Perceptron Algorithm

Perceptron is a single layer neural network and a multi-layer perceptron is called Neural Networks.
Perceptron is a linear classifier (binary). Also, it is used in supervised learning.


The perceptron consists of 4 parts .

> Input values or One input layer
> Weights and Bias
> Net sum
> Activation Function
